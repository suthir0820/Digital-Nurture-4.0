Exercise 2.1 - Explore Structure
When we download Bootstrap, the folder contains several important subfolders. Here's an explanation of the key ones:

css/
This folder contains the main Bootstrap stylesheets.
The file bootstrap.min.css is the minified version of Bootstrap's CSS.
It includes predefined styles for layout, typography, colors, spacing, buttons, forms, etc.

js/
This folder contains Bootstrap's JavaScript files.
bootstrap.bundle.min.js is the minified JavaScript bundle that includes both Bootstrap's JS plugins and Popper.js, which is required for tooltips and popovers to work.
It enables dynamic components like modal, carousel, dropdown, and collapse.

icons/ 
Contains Bootstrap Icons, which are SVG-based icon files.
These icons can be used in UI design (like buttons, alerts, navbars, etc.).

Exercise 2.2 - Include Bootstrap JS Plugins
To include Bootstrap's JavaScript functionality in your HTML page, you must add the following line before the closing </body> tag:

<script src="bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>

This script enables the following Bootstrap components:
Modal- For pop-up dialogs
Carousel- For image sliders
Dropdown- For toggleable dropdown menus
Collapse- For expanding/collapsing content (like accordions)

The .bundle.min.js file includes both Bootstrap's core JavaScript and the Popper library, so you don't need to include them separately.
