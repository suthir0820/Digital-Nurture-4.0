Exercise 3.2 – Use Bootstrap grid classes appropriately

To achieve responsive layouts, use these Bootstrap grid classes:
.container – Wraps content in a responsive fixed-width container.
.row – Creates a horizontal group of columns.
.col-* – Defines how much width a column should take based on the screen size:
.col-12 (mobile)
.col-sm-6 (tablet)
.col-md-4 (desktop)

These classes allow the layout to adapt to different screen sizes automatically.
